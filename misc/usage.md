Install
----------------------------------------------------------

```
composer install walter-a-jablonowski/simple-nutrition-counter
```


Common usage
----------------------------------------------------------

- Manual entering values: current solution is page reload on save
- We include at least some supplements like magnesium to make sure we get the required amount. For some it may be enough to just take it regularly with no tracking.

Foods file (foods.yml)
----------------------------------------------------------

Currently we enter the values once in data/foods.yml. Simpler than doing manual calculations (partially used ingredients).
