Install
----------------------------------------------------------

```
composer install walter-a-jablonowski/simple-nutrition-counter
```


Common usage
----------------------------------------------------------

- Manual entering values: current solution is page reload on save
- We include at least some supplements like magnesium to make sure we get the required amount. For some it may be enough to just take it regularly with no tracking.

Data files below see /data


Recipes file usage (recipes.yml)
----------------------------------------------------------

```yaml

My recipe:
                     # amount:
  Chick R Bio:  100g # < 0 (1/2)    is percent of pack
  Brokkoli R:        # > 0 (e.g. 2) is piece(s)
  Oliven√∂l:          # or with "g" (100g), "ml" (100ml)
```

Foods file usage (foods.yml)
----------------------------------------------------------

Currently we enter the values once in data/foods.yml. Simpler than doing manual calculations (partially used ingredients).

```yaml

My food S Bio:                      # S = short for store if needed (save some space)

  product:            "..."         # precise product name

  nutriVal:           "less|occasionally"  # highlight less good or acceptable occasionally ingredients
  comment:            "..."         # all misc comments
  ingredients:        "..."         # ingredients that you want to be aware of
  origin:             "..."         # country of origin, if you want to be aware of

  price:              1.00

  weight:             100g          # unit g or ml is optional, of whole pack in case of pieces
  pieces:             6             # number of pieces in a pack (if any)
  usedAmounts:        ["1/4", ...]  # enter fraction, pieces or precise (you can't mix these, chosse one)
                                    # - default  "1/4", "1/3", 1 * weight            if pieces unset
                                    # -      or  1, 1pc, 2, 3    * (weight / pieces) if pieces set
                                    # - or use   10g or 50ml
                                    # consumed as a single piece: use 1
