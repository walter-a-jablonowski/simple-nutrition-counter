Install
----------------------------------------------------------

```
composer install walter-a-jablonowski/simple-nutrition-counter
```


Common usage
----------------------------------------------------------

- Manual entering values: current solution is page reload on save
- We include at least some supplements like magnesium to make sure we get the required amount. For some it may be enough to just take it regularly with no tracking.

Data files below see /data


Users
----------------------------------------------------------

/users/USER/-this.yml

Settings file

(advanced feature)


days
----------------------------------------------------------

(fill me)


User nutrient files
----------------------------------------------------------

(advanced feature)

Same as [Nutrient files](#nutrient-files), overrides settings.


Bundles
----------------------------------------------------------

/bundes/BUNDLE/-this.yml

see also [readme](../src/data/bundles/README.md)


Foods file
----------------------------------------------------------

Currently we enter the values once in data/bundles/BUNDLE/foods.yml. Simpler
than doing manual calculations (partially used ingredients).

Field info available in app as well (in development), see def file [inline_help/foods.yml](../src/misc/inline_help/foods.yml)


Supplements file
----------------------------------------------------------

nearly same as foods


Recipes file
----------------------------------------------------------

```yaml

My recipe:
                     # amount:
  Chick R Bio:  100g # < 0 (1/2)    is percent of pack
  Brokkoli R:        # > 0 (e.g. 2) is piece(s)
  Oliven√∂l:          # or with "g" (100g), "ml" (100ml)
```

Layout file
----------------------------------------------------------

- for upper part of nutrients list
- left over recipes nutrients will be attached below
- you can add each food multiple times

```yaml

-- Data --------     -- Layout --------
