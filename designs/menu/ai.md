Can you make a round button that hovers over an html page in the lower right corner? Whan it is pressed menu entries appear above it. When a menu entry is pressed, an action is performed by triggering a js function. Make a demo page with bootstrap 5.3 that has 3 hidden divs with some demo content (the first is visible initially). Each menu eintry makes on e of the hidden content divs visible and hides the rest.
