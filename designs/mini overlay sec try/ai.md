Can you make a replacement for the tippyjs library (https://atomiks.github.io/tippyjs)? Make it as simple as possible. It is shown on click and/or hover, which can be defined with a data attribute (default: click only). The content to show should be read from a data attribute of the clicked element. Add a placement option as data attribute (left, right, top, bottom). Please use 2 spaces for indent.
