
- used first page sample and merged in PC content sample
- ~~added nav bar from main app, added fixed-top class~~

- [x] content areas look a little high
- [ ] smartphone no full height of day list using BS classes, also show goals
  - [ ] flex or h-100? (maybe move in classes with media queries so that this isn't used on
    smartphones in portrait, see "from content sample")
- [ ] rm the food list on smartphone using BS classes, add a btn for modal
  - we could also use the ignore that for now (solve smartphone later)
