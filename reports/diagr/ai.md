
In the folder "diagr" make a tool that reads all tsv files from the folder which is defined in config.yml > source

Columns in the tsv file:

- time
- type
- food
- calories
- fat
- carbs
- amino
- salt
- price
- json with details

tsv files are seperated with spaces (no tab), at least 2 spaces befor each column

Make a new html page in that folder with seperate line charts for:

- calories
- fat
- carbs
- amino
- salt
- price

Each source file contains the data of a day (the date is the file name).
x-axis of the charts: dates
y-axis: sum for the nutrient for this day (e.g. fat sum)

units: kcal for calories, grams for nutrients

Also add a horizontal line in each chart for the limit defined in config.yml (if any)

Keep js php, html, js code and styles in seperate files
