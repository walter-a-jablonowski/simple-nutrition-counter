
I use bootstrap 5.3 and need a special layout with navbars.

### Navbar

- In landscapes (PC or tablets or smartphones in landscape mode)
  - vertical bar on the right side of the screen (which doesn't take up too much space)
  - has a group of icons in the top and a group of icons on the buttom
- In portrait (smartphones in portrait mode)
  - horizontal bar at the bottom of the screen
  - all icons are distributed equally on the bar

Be sure that the right menu is visible depending on the screen size.

navbar bg color: black'ish (something that looks stylish), light font color

### Page layout

- In landscapes mode (PC or tablets or smartphones in landscape mode)
  - 2 cols where the first takes 1/3 of the available space, while the second takes 2/3
- In portrait mode (smartphones in portrait mode)
  - col 1 is above of col 2 instead of beside
