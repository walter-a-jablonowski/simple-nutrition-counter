<ul class="no-indent">
  <li>No tool, just use a jug</li>
  <li>Put it where you see it during the day, make empty until evening</li>
  <li>Add taste: use a tiny amount of juice (but no more cause has much sugar)</li>
  <li>Citrus fruits: contain a substance that reduces stress in brain</li>
</ul>

<b>Fast healthy cooking: make bowls</b>

<ul class="no-indent">
  <li>Put stuff in a bowl</li>
  <li>Make some of the ingredients warm in a mini oven or microwave</li>
  <li>Add more ingredients => ready in under 10 minutes</li>
  <li>Sample: veggie bowl with broccoli, lentils or chickpeas, olive oil, a little bit of feta cheese for the taste, spices and whatever greens you want to add ...</li>
</ul>

<b>Minimize harmful substances in food</b>

<ul class="no-indent">
  <li>Buy food that is tested independently on a regular basis</li>
  <li>Buy brands that are certified or known for testing their own products</li>
  <li>no tests available: buy organic food from vendors where you've seen good quality and they make an effort</li>
  <li>if unsure: buy same product from alternating vendors</li>
  <li>be aware that some foods often have problems: e.g. coffee, cocoa, olive oil, ...</li>
</ul>

<b>Supplements</b>

<ul class="no-indent">
  <li>It might make sense to fill up some missing substances with some supplements</li>
  <li>Dosage while production often goes wrong (e.g. Vit D 3-4 times)</li>
  <li>Try to get independent studies like <a href="https://www-test-de.translate.goog/Vitamine-Viele-Praeparate-sind-deutlich-zu-hoch-dosiert-5220730-5220744/?_x_tr_sl=de&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=de&_x_tr_pto=wapp" target="_blank">this</a> (translated from German)</li>
  <li>Assume too much and take only a part of it</li>
  <li>Use multiple brands</li>
</ul>

<b>Movement (sports)</b>

<ul class="no-indent">
  <li>Humans were designed for movement. Movement also activates sectors in the brain that are switched off while sitting.</li>
</ul>

<b>Stress</b>

<ul class="no-indent">
  <li>Humans were designed for short term stress only (minutes). Avoid whole day stress, do things stressless and take breaks.</li>
</ul>
