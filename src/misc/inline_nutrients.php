<p>Foods don't always contain the same amount of nutrients. It depends on e.g.</p>

<ul class="no-indent">
  <li>exact plant variety</li>
  <li>type soild where it was planted</li>
  <li>time of year, amount of sunlight</li>
  <li>and so on ... (also true for meat)</li>
</ul>

<p>All of these have influence on the amount of nutrients in the food. This list uses reference data that gives you a rough approximation of the actual amount of nutrients in your food. At least this gives you an idea about your nutrient supply as good as possible. You may want to eat some less of a cetain food if a value might be too high, or use a supplement if something is far too low.</p>

<p>Also keep in mind that it's hard to get a good approximation with food packages that contain multiple ingedients. Using single foods is best.</p>
