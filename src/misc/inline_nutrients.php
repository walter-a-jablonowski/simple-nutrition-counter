<p>Foods don't always contain the same amount of nutrients. It depends on e.g.</p>

<ul class="no-indent">
  <li>exact plant variety</li>
  <li>soil type where it is from</li>
  <li>time of year, amount of sunlight</li>
  <li>and so on ... (also true for meat)</li>
</ul>

<p>This list uses reference data that gives you a rough approximation of the amount of nutrients in your food. Nutrient recommendations where the recommended amount is higher might be more reliable (grams or high milligrams). Those where the recommended nutrient amount is low (only low mg) are hard to track.</p>

<p>It gives you an idea about your nutrient supply as good as possible. Eat some less of a cetain food if the amount might be too high, or use a supplement if if a bar with a high recommended amount is constantly emtpy.</p>

<p>Also keep in mind that you need to use pure foods. It's hard to get a good approximation for food packages that contain multiple ingedients.</p>
