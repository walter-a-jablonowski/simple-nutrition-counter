  # TASK: 2 AIs say that only ALA and LA must be from food and the body can make the rest
  #       but:
  #       - this is only acc to current science
  #       - doesn't necessarily mean that enough can be made
  #       - e.g. DHA is missing here (there are recommendations for it per day)
  #       - most likely we must have all essential, see list attached: "Conditionally Essential"

  # TASK: there are possibly unexplored ones
