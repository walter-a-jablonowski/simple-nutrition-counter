
# Trying to use AI as data source again (deep research)

# 
# I am looking for reference nutritional values of [FILL ME]. Please fill out the yml below starting from calories.
# 
# Be sure that you have the most high quality data source for the reference values.
# 
# - Keep the yml formatting as it is, remove no blanks before the value
# - Use the unit that is written above each nutrient group or beside the nutrients
# - Enter "0" if the food doesn't contain the nutrient, leave it blank if this is unknown
# - Add nutritional values with no "g" or "mg", just the float or int
# - For each value you add write the source url as a comment beside it
# - Leave out-commented lines as they are
