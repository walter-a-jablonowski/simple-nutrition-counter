
Trying to use AI as data source again (deep research)

results from 2 AIs that used different sources are pretty similar => could be used


I am looking for reference nutritional values of [FILL ME]. Please fill out the yml below starting from calories.

Be sure that you have the most high quality data source for the reference values.

- Keep the yml formatting as it is, remove no blanks before the value
- Use the unit that is written above each nutrient group or beside the nutrients
- Enter "0" if the food doesn't contain the nutrient, leave it blank if this is unknown
- Add nutritional values with no "g" or "mg", just the float or int
- For each value you add write the source url as a comment beside it (be sure to use the link to the exact page)
- The values for salt and fibre appear in 2 places in the yml structure (enter them 2 times)
- Leave out-commented lines as they are


The yml:
