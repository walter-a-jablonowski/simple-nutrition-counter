> AI: Clause and GPT 2408 all "Beside fatty acids, carbs, amino acids, vitamins, minerals, electrolytes and secondary plant substances are there nutrient groups to consider?"
>
> Are there more group or is this all?


Main all known and

- Phytonutrients/Secondary plant substances
- Probiotics and Prebiotics
- Enzymes
- Nucleotides
- Antioxidants

All

- Water
- Macronutrients

  - Carbs

    - Fiber: While technically a type of carbohydrate, dietary fiber is often considered a separate nutrient group due to its unique properties and health benefits.
    - Amino
    - Fat

- Micronutrients

  - Vit
  - Minerals
    - electrolytes
    - Trace elements: These are minerals required in very small amounts, like selenium, iodine, and zinc. They're part of the broader mineral category but are sometimes discussed separately.

- Phytonutrients
 
  - Secondary
  - Phytonutrients (or phytochemicals): These are bioactive compounds found in plants that may have health benefits. While you mentioned secondary plant substances, phytonutrients are sometimes classified separately.

- Misc Bioactive Compounds
  
  - Antioxidants: While many antioxidants fall under vitamins or phytonutrients, they're sometimes considered a separate category due to their specific role in neutralizing free radicals.
  - Endogenous Antioxidants: While antioxidants are commonly thought of as vitamins or plant compounds, the body produces its own, such as superoxide dismutase and catalase, which are critical for managing oxidative stress.
  - Probiotics: These are beneficial microorganisms that can support gut health and overall wellbeing.
  - Prebiotics: These are non-digestible food components that promote the growth of beneficial gut bacteria.
  - Enzymes: While no strictly nutrients, digestive enzymes play a crucial role in breaking down food and absorbing nutrients.
  - Bioactive Peptides: These are specific protein fragments that can have positive effects on health, such as antihypertensive or antimicrobial properties.
  - Glycosides: These are molecules in which a sugar is bound to a non-carbohydrate moiety, often contributing to the therapeutic effects of plants.
  - Methyl Donors: Nutrients like folate, betaine, and methionine that are involved in methylation processes in the body, which are critical for DNA repair and gene expression.
  - Organic acids: Found in fruits and fermented foods, these can play roles in flavor and potential health benefits.

- Nucleotides and Nucleic Acids
  
  - Nucleotides/Nucleic Acid: These are the building blocks of DNA and RNA, and while our bodies can produce them, they are sometimes considered a semi-essential nutrient, especially for infants or people under stress.

- Specialized Nutrients

  - Choline and Other Specialized Nutrients: Choline is essential for liver function, brain development, and muscle movement, but it's sometimes categorized separately from vitamins and amino acids.
  - Hormones in Food: Although not traditionally categorized as nutrients, certain hormones present in food can have biological effects when consumed.
