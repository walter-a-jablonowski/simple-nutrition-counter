(reduced list)

- Hormones

  - similar: in geneal broken down first (but can buy as supplemnt)
  - Steroid Hormones: These are made from cholesterol, which is a lipid
    - estrogen testosterone, cortisol, ...
  - Peptide Hormones, composed of amino acids
  - Amine Hormones: Derived from the amino acid
    - tyrosine, adrenaline, ...

- Misc Bioactive Compounds
  
  - Glycosides: These are molecules in which a sugar is bound to a non-carbohydrate moiety, often contributing to the therapeutic effects of plants.
  - Methyl Donors: Nutrients like folate, betaine, and methionine that are involved in methylation processes in the body, which are critical for DNA repair and gene expression.
  - Organic acids: Found in fruits and fermented foods, these can play roles in flavor and potential health benefits.

- Nucleotides and Nucleic Acids
  
  - Nucleotides/Nucleic Acid: These are the building blocks of DNA and RNA, and while our bodies can produce them, they are sometimes considered a semi-essential nutrient, especially for infants or people under stress.
