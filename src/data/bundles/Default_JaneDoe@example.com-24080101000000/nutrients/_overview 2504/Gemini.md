I. Macronutrients (Nutrients needed in relatively large amounts; primarily provide energy and building materials)

A.  **Carbohydrates (Carbs)** (Primary energy source)
    1.  **Simple Carbohydrates (Sugars)**
        * Monosaccharides (e.g., Glucose, Fructose, Galactose)
        * Disaccharides (e.g., Sucrose, Lactose, Maltose)
    2.  **Complex Carbohydrates**
        * Polysaccharides (Starches)
        * Fiber (Often indigestible or partially digestible polysaccharides)
            * Soluble Fiber
            * Insoluble Fiber

B.  **Proteins** (Building blocks for tissues, enzymes, hormones; can provide energy)
    1.  **Amino Acids** (Building blocks of proteins)
        * Essential Amino Acids (Must be obtained from diet)
        * Non-Essential Amino Acids (Body can synthesize)
        * Conditionally Essential Amino Acids (Needed under specific circumstances)

C.  **Lipids (Fats)** (Energy storage, cell structure, hormone production, absorption of fat-soluble vitamins)
    1.  **Triglycerides** (Main form of dietary fat and stored fat)
        * Glycerol
        * **Fatty Acids**
            * Saturated Fatty Acids (SFAs)
            * Unsaturated Fatty Acids
                * Monounsaturated Fatty Acids (MUFAs)
                * Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids (PUFAs)
                    * Omega-3 Fatty Acids (Essential - e.g., ALA, EPA, DHA)
                    * Omega-6 Fatty Acids (Essential - e.g., Linoleic Acid)
            * Trans Fatty Acids (Often categorized separately due to health effects)
    2.  **Phospholipids** (Component of cell membranes, e.g., Lecithin)
    3.  **Sterols** (e.g., Cholesterol - involved in hormone synthesis and cell membranes)
II. Micronutrients (Nutrients needed in smaller amounts; crucial for metabolic processes, structure, and regulation)

A.  **Vitamins** (Organic compounds essential for various metabolic functions)
    1.  **Fat-Soluble Vitamins** (Stored in body fat)
        * Vitamin A (Retinoids and Carotenoids)
        * Vitamin D (Calciferol)
        * Vitamin E (Tocopherols and Tocotrienols)
        * Vitamin K (Phylloquinone and Menaquinones)
    2.  **Water-Soluble Vitamins** (Generally not stored long-term)
        * Vitamin C (Ascorbic Acid)
        * B Vitamins (Complex):
            * B1 (Thiamine)
            * B2 (Riboflavin)
            * B3 (Niacin)
            * B5 (Pantothenic Acid)
            * B6 (Pyridoxine)
            * B7 (Biotin)
            * B9 (Folate/Folic Acid)
            * B12 (Cobalamin)

B.  **Minerals** (Inorganic elements essential for structure, fluid balance, and metabolic processes)
    1.  **Macrominerals** (Needed in larger amounts)
        * Calcium (Ca)
        * Phosphorus (P) (Often as Phosphate)
        * Potassium (K)
        * Sulfur (S)
        * Sodium (Na)
        * Chloride (Cl)
        * Magnesium (Mg)
    2.  **Trace Minerals** (Needed in smaller amounts)
        * Iron (Fe)
        * Zinc (Zn)
        * Copper (Cu)
        * Manganese (Mn)
        * Iodine (I)
        * Selenium (Se)
        * Molybdenum (Mo)
        * Chromium (Cr)
        * Fluoride (F) (Often added, debated if strictly essential but beneficial for teeth/bones)
        * Cobalt (Co) (Essential as part of Vitamin B12)
    3.  **Electrolytes** *(Functional Subgroup of Minerals)*: Minerals that carry an electric charge when dissolved in body fluids; crucial for nerve impulses, muscle contractions, and fluid balance.
        * *Primary Examples:* Sodium (Na+), Potassium (K+), Chloride (Cl-), Calcium (Ca2+), Magnesium (Mg2+), Phosphate (HPO4 2-/H2PO4 -), Bicarbonate (HCO3-) (Bicarbonate is often regulated alongside electrolytes but isn't a dietary mineral itself).
        * *Note:* This shows multiple "parentage" â€“ these are minerals (Macro or Trace) that *also* function as electrolytes.
III. Water (Often considered its own essential nutrient category; vital for nearly all bodily functions)

Related Concepts (Often discussed alongside nutrients but not always classified as essential nutrients):

Energy (Calories): Not a nutrient itself, but the product derived from metabolizing Macronutrients (and alcohol). Measured in Calories or Joules.
Phytonutrients/Phytochemicals: Compounds found in plants (e.g., Flavonoids, Carotenoids, Polyphenols) that are not essential for life like vitamins/minerals but can have significant health benefits.
Ethanol (Alcohol): Provides calories (energy) but is not considered an essential nutrient and has toxic effects.
