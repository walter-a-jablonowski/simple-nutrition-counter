  <b>Concept</b>

  <ul class="no-indent">
    <li>
      Avoid all mass produced that humans weren't meant to eat,
      prefer what evolution made use for before invention of agriculture
    </li><li>
      Stay low carb ~50g, TASK: fat:amino 2:1, ~3l water daily
    </li><li>
      Change some food daily, don't use too much of one on a daily basis
    </li><li>
      Use limited fastening as a tool to simulate food shortage and activate survival mechanisms, e.g. try to eat no longer than 4-6 hours ("eat less often")
    </li><li>
      Also have days with more food to fill up
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p style="color: orange;">Food list is made in a way so that these foods can easily be chosen</p>
