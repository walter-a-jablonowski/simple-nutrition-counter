# Abstract concept

# framework     = a single idea that you can use for doing the right thing
# miscImportant = misc important things 2 do

framework: |

  Avoid all mass produced that humans weren't meant to eat (<a href="#ref2">2</a>),
  prefer what evolution made use for before invention of agriculture
  (6-15k years is no long time)

miscImportant: |

  <li>
    Stay low carb ~50g humans don't need carbs (<a href="#ref2">2</a>),
    TASK: fat:amino 2:1, ~3l water daily
  </li><li>
    Change some food daily, don't use too much of one on a daily basis
    "it's about balance" (<a href="#ref1">1</a>)
  </li><li>
    Use limited fastening as a tool to simulate food shortage and activate
    survival mechanisms (<a href="#ref1">1</a>), e.g. try to eat no longer
    than 4-6 hours ("eat less often"), means: eat all meals at once
  </li><li>
    Also have days with more food to fill up (just in case)
  </li>
