  Avoid all mass produced that humans weren't meant to eat (<a href="#ref2">2</a>),

    <li>
      Change some food daily, don't use too much of one on a daily basis

      ~3l water daily <a href="#tipsNutritionPane" data-bs-toggle="tab" data-bs-target="#tipsTrackWater">(use a jug)</a>
    </li><li>
      <b>Fastening days:</b> Use limited fastening as a tool to simulate food shortage and activate
      survival mechanisms (<a href="#ref1">1</a>), e.g. try to eat no longer
      than 4-6 hours ("eat less often"), means: eat all meals at once.
      <b>Or:</b> calories reduced ~1800 kcal for a couple of days.
    </li><li>
      <b>Fill up energy:</b> Also have days with more food to fill up (just in case) ~2500 kcal
    </li><li>
      <b>Workout day:</b> Amino acids: 1.6 or 1.8 - 2.2g per kg weight (gain muscle),
      Magnesium
    </li><li>
      <b>On the go</b> the best food that is available is used
