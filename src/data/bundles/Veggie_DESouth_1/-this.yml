  <b>Concept</b>

  <ul class="no-indent">
    <li>Avoid all mass produced that humans weren't meant to eat,
        prefer what evolution made use for before invention of agriculture</li>
    <li>Stay low carb ~50g, change some food daily</li>
    <li>Use limited fastening as a tool to simulate food shortage and activate survival mechanisms,
        e.g. try to eat no longer than 4-6 hours ("eat less often")</li>
    <li>Also intentionally have days with more food to fill up</li>
    <li>~3l water daily</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    <b>For fun:</b> Includes one cheat day per week as well as "micro candy" daily (tiny piece only or sugar-free).
  </p>

  <p>
    On the go the best food that is available is used.

  If doing sports higher amounts of amino acids and magnesium are used.
