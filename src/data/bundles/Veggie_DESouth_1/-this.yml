  <b>Concept</b>

  <ul class="no-indent">
    <li>Avoid all mass produced that humans weren't meant to eat</li>
    <li>Prefer what evolution made use for before invention of agriculture</li>
    <li>Stay low carb ~50g, no processed foods</li>
    <li>Use limited fastening as a tool to simulate food shortage and activate survival mechanisms</li>
    <li>e.g. try to eat no longer than 4-6 hours ("eat less often")</li>
    <li>Also intentionally have days with more kcal to fill up</li>
    <li>Be sure have ~3l water, change some food daily</li>
  </ul>

    <b>For fun:</b> Includes one cheat day per week as well as "micro candy" daily (tiny piece only or sugar-free).

  <p>
    On the go the best food that is available is used.

  If doing sports higher amounts of amino acids and magnesium are used.
